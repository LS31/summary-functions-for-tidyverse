Title: Summary Functions for the Tidyverse
Version: 0.3.0
Author: Lars Steggink
Maintainer: Lars Steggink <contact@larssteggink.nl>
Description: At this time, the package is no longer actively maintained. I would suggest migrating to a combination of the packages janitor, skimr, and ggstatsplot for better, more comprehensive functionality. This packages was designed to quickly create summary statistics and summary graphs for multiple variables of a 'tibble' or data frame at once, using combining the powers of the 'tidyverse' and using the standard selectors available in 'dplyr'.
